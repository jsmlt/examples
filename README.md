# JSMLT: Examples
This repository contains some basic JSMLT and VisualML examples, intended to get you started with the libraries. Each example is contained in a sub-folder of this repository, predixed by the example number. For example, the first example can be found `01-getting-started`. To get started with the examples, clone the repository:
```
> git clone git@github.com:jsmlt/examples.git
```
Then, navigate to the folder of the example you want to run and follow the instructions in the readme file. Why don't you give [the first example a try](https://github.com/jsmlt/examples/tree/master/01-getting-started)?
