# JSMLT: Examples
This repository contains some basic JSMLT and VisualML examples, intended to get you started with the libraries. First, simply clone the repository and navigate to the newly cloned folder:
```
> git clone git@github.com:jsmlt/examples.git
> cd examples
```
Then, navigate to the folder of the example you want to check out, and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file inside the folder. For example, for example `01-getting-started`, simply navigate to the folder and run `npm install`:
```
> cd 01-getting-started
> npm install
```
Now, you can run the example, which is stored in `index.js`, by running `npm start`:
```
> npm start
[ 1, 1, 0, 0 ]
```
