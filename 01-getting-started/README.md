# Example 01: Getting Started
In this example, we've built a very simple linear SVM classifier. To run the example, clone the examples repository and navigate to this example's folder (as instructed [here](https://github.com/jsmlt/examples)). Then, install the package:
```
> npm install
```
Then, run the example with
```
> npm start
```

This will output the classification result for our test data set of data points:
```
[ 1, 1, 0, 0 ]
```
